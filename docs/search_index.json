However, in practice I always find myself copying an existing, working book and modifying it instead of starting from scratch. So this tutorial is going to have you do that as well, using this book as the one you copy from. [more setup here] You will have to name your books repository. To differentiate your books repo name from this bookdown-tutorial repo, here well call your book awesome-book but you should consistently name it what you want to name it. 2.1 Get bookdown-tutorial going on your local computer Go to https://github.com/jules32/bookdown-tutorial Click the green clone or download button and DOWNLOAD ZIP. Locally on your computer, unzip the folder, save it in a reasonable place Rename 2 things from bookdown-tutorial to awesome-book. You can do this in the finder/windows explorer: the folder itself (that you just unzipped) the .Rproj file Double-click the .Rproj file to launch RStudio Install packages and restart install.packages(\"bookdown\") install.packages(\"usethis\") Use the menu item Session &gt; Restart R Click on the Build tab in the top right pane Click on Build Book!

This will restart R and give you a new Git tab in the upper right pane. Now, click on the Terminal tab next to the Console tab. Type git remote add origin &lt;paste your copied awesome-book github url here&gt; Type git push --set-upstream origin master 2.4 Publish awesome-book Last steps! Go back to github.com/username/awesome-book and refresh  our files should be there! But we want it to be a book published as https://username.github.io/awesome-book.
